# Welcome!
Thank you for paying attention to my project. I am always open to feedback or revision of my code, but in order for everyone to understand each other, I made small rules.

# Write code according to the rules of Dart
Most of the rules are described in analysis_options.yaml and automatically loaded by your IDE. Also, do not forget about the existence of a single code style (https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style ).

# Respect the community
1. Read CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
2. It is important that you are understood, do not forget about the documentation. In our project, it is accepted in English.
3. Respect the work and efforts of others, regardless of their level of knowledge. If you know how to optimize the code, give advice in the comments.

# It's better to think 10 times than to rewrite 10 times.
Thinking through how to use your code competently in the future is one of the most important skills. I will definitely look at your Pull Request, where we can exchange ideas on how to create something correctly.
